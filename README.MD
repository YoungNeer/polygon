Polygon is a simple social media website which - although nothing compared to any of *real* social media sites out there, yet serves the purpose for which it was built - *for learning*!

You can make posts, comment on them, add friends and see their posts and like them comment on them.

## Contribution

Although it's a pet project of mine yet I don't mind if you want to contribute something to it. Just make a PR and we'll see where we get.
Also you can point out bugs in the issues and make a PR if u know how to solve it!
Cheers
